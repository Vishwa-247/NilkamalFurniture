# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The navbar hover functionality needs to be fixed and made fully responsive across all devices. Currently, users are experiencing issues with hover states not working properly on navigation items, and the responsive behavior needs improvement for mobile and tablet devices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual feedback when hovering over navigation items, so that I can understand which items are interactive and navigate the site intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over any navigation dropdown trigger THEN the system SHALL display a visual hover state with color change and smooth transition
2. WHEN a user hovers over navigation dropdown items THEN the system SHALL highlight the item with background color change and text color change
3. WHEN a user moves the mouse away from a navigation item THEN the system SHALL remove the hover state smoothly with the same transition duration
4. WHEN a user hovers over navigation items THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent hover behavior across all navigation components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the navigation to work properly on touch devices, so that I can navigate the site effectively on my phone or tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the site on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized navigation menu
2. WHEN a user taps on navigation items on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch feedback
3. WHEN a user accesses the site on tablet devices THEN the system SHALL maintain hover functionality for devices that support it
4. IF the device supports touch THEN the system SHALL handle both touch and hover interactions appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the navigation dropdowns to open and close smoothly, so that I have a pleasant browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user hovers over a dropdown trigger THEN the system SHALL open the dropdown with a smooth animation after a brief delay
2. WHEN a user moves the mouse away from a dropdown THEN the system SHALL close the dropdown after a brief delay to allow for mouse movement errors
3. WHEN a user moves the mouse from the trigger to the dropdown content THEN the system SHALL keep the dropdown open
4. WHEN a user presses the Escape key THEN the system SHALL close any open dropdowns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual styling across all navigation elements, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigation items are in their default state THEN the system SHALL display consistent typography, spacing, and colors
2. WHEN navigation items are hovered THEN the system SHALL apply consistent hover styles across all navigation components
3. WHEN navigation items are active/selected THEN the system SHALL display a distinct active state that differs from hover
4. WHEN transitions occur THEN the system SHALL use consistent timing and easing functions across all navigation elements
